# Sorting Tests
Performing runtime tests of Insertion, Selection and Merge sort.

Hi,

Here I:

1. generate different array types (random, ascending, descending)
2. run arrays through 3 different sorting algorithms (insertion, selection, merge)
3. record their runtime

This project demonstrates my ability to:
1. handle complex functions (mergesort was a real pain)
2. properly comment my code; good legibility
3. light use of chrono library
